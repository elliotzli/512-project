## Playing Against the Elements: How Environmental Factors Influence Baseball Game Outcomes

### ANLY-512 project-group 32
### Team members: Ryan Walter, Eliot Li, Yu Tao

This project studied the impact of weather on baseball performance. Data from [Major League Baseball (MLB) games played between 2010 and 2015](https://www.retrosheet.org/) were collected, along with corresponding [weather data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) from the cities where the games were held.

Gaming variables include date, team name, game score, attandence, at bat, hits, home runs, rbi, walks, strikeouts, stolen bases, left on bases, pitchers used, wild pitches, balks, and errors.
Weather variables include average wind speed, precipitation, snowfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind direction, and weather type.

The techniques used include exploratory data analysis, k-means clustering, and neural network. Exploratory data analysis was employed to search for correlations between variables, and it revealed a subtle association between game performance and weather. K-means clustering was used to discover similarities between gams records, which provided evidence that  certain underlying weather combinations might lead to unique game results. Neural networks were used for modeling and predicting penalized strikeouts, number of hits, and number of errors. Small RMSE and MAE values demonstrated the feasibility of using weather data to predict game performances.

The study demonstarted the impact of weather and environment on baseball performances. It was also found that weather had a greater impact on pitching and hitting than on the number of errors.
